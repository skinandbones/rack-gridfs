==== Features

- Allow configuration of MongoDB authentication (Steve Sloan)
- Allow option to look up objects by GridFS filename instead of +ObjectId+
  (SHIBATA Hiroshi)
- Return iterable GridIO object instead of file contents, so Rack can stream in
  chunks (Ches Martin)
- <tt>Rack::GridFS::Endpoint</tt>: support for mounting as a Rack endpoint in
  addition to middleware (Ben Marini)
- Cache headers: set <tt>Last-Modified</tt> and +Etag+ so that
  <tt>Rack::ConditionalGet</tt> sends 304s. +expires+ option to set
  <tt>Cache-Control</tt> (Alexander Gr√§fe & Ben Marini)
- <tt>mime-types</tt> dependency so GridFS lib can determine content types
  (Ben Marini)
- You can now pass a <tt>Mongo::DB</tt> instance instead of discrete database
  configuration parameters. Connections are retried so we take advantage of a
  +ReplSetConnection+ in high-availability architectures (Ben Marini)

==== Bug Fixes

- <tt>BSON::ObjectID</tt> renamed to +ObjectId+, and other changes supporting
  current versions of Mongo libraries
